A voice-first AI assistant that turns your Telegram messages into an organized knowledge base. Send voice notes, text, photos, or forwarded messages — the agent classifies everything, creates tasks in Todoist, saves thoughts to an Obsidian vault, tracks your goals, and sends you a daily report. Your personal second brain that runs 24/7 on a $5 VPS.

## What's New in v2

- **Agent Memory** — Ebbinghaus forgetting curve with tiered decay. Memory cards move through tiers (core / active / warm / cold / archive) based on access patterns and time.
- **Vault Health** — Automated health scoring, Map of Content (MOC) generation, broken link repair, and orphan detection across your entire vault.
- **3-Phase Pipeline** — Processing is now split into CAPTURE, EXECUTE, and REFLECT phases with structured JSON handoff between each stage.
- **Processing Rules** — Configurable formatting rules for Obsidian markdown and weekly reflections.
- **Memory Config** — `.memory-config.json` file for fine-tuning decay rates, tier thresholds, and type inference rules.

## Architecture

```
Telegram (voice / text / photo / forwarded messages)
    |
    v
Telegram Bot (Node.js) --> Deepgram (voice-to-text)
    |
    v
Claude Code (--print --dangerously-skip-permissions)
    |
    v
+-- CAPTURE: classify entries --> JSON
+-- EXECUTE: Todoist tasks + vault writes --> JSON
+-- REFLECT: HTML report + MEMORY update
    |
    v
+-- Todoist (tasks)
+-- Obsidian vault (thoughts, CRM, goals)
+-- Telegram (HTML report)
+-- GitHub (git push)
```

The bot runs as a systemd service on a VPS. A daily timer (21:00 UTC) triggers the 3-phase processing pipeline via `scripts/process.sh`. Each phase receives the previous phase's output as structured JSON, ensuring reliable handoff and auditability.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agent-second-brain.git
cd agent-second-brain
```

### 3. Fill in templates

Open the following files and replace the placeholders with your information:

- `vault/goals/0-vision-3y.md` — 3-year vision

### 4. Get API keys

| Token | Where to get it |
|-------|-----------------|
| Telegram Bot Token | [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in Telegram |
| Your Telegram ID | [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) in Telegram |
| Deepgram API Key | [console.deepgram.com](https://console.deepgram.com/) |
| Todoist API Token | [todoist.com](https://todoist.com) → Settings → Integrations → Developer |

### 5. Deploy to VPS

Follow the detailed server setup guide: **[docs/vps-setup.md](docs/vps-setup.md)**

Short version:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
# Create a user, install dependencies, clone repo, configure .env
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agent-second-brain/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

---

## Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.env` | API tokens for Telegram, Deepgram, Todoist (copy from `.env.example`) |
| `.memory-config.json` | Decay rates, tier thresholds, type inference rules for agent memory |
| `mcp-config.json` | MCP server configuration (Todoist and other integrations) |
| `vault/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Agent instructions, session bootstrap sequence, navigation rules |
| `vault/.claude/skills/dbrain-processor/references/about.md` | Your personal profile — helps the agent understand context |

All secrets go into `.env` which is gitignored. Never commit API tokens to the repository.

## Vault Structure

    ├── rules/          # Formatting rules (obsidian-markdown, weekly-reflection)
    └── docs/           # Reference documentation
```

The vault follows a Zettelkasten-inspired structure. Each domain has an `_index.md` hub file. Navigation starts from hubs and follows wiki-links.

## How It Works

### 3-Phase Pipeline

The daily processing pipeline runs in three isolated phases:

1. **CAPTURE** — Reads `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, classifies each entry (task, thought, idea, CRM update, goal progress), and outputs structured JSON.
2. **EXECUTE** — Takes the classification JSON, creates Todoist tasks, writes vault files, updates CRM cards, and outputs an execution report as JSON.
3. **REFLECT** — Generates an HTML summary report, updates `MEMORY.md` with key decisions, and sends the report to Telegram.

Each phase runs as a separate Claude Code invocation. JSON is passed between phases via files, ensuring clean boundaries and debuggability.

### Memory Decay

Agent memory follows the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve with linear decay:

- **Decay rate:** 0.015 per day
- **Floor:** 0.1 (memories never fully disappear)
- **Formula:** `strength = max(floor, initial - rate * days_since_access)`

Memory cards move through five tiers based on their current strength:

| Tier | Strength Range | Behavior |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **core** | 0.9 - 1.0 | Always loaded into context |
| **active** | 0.7 - 0.9 | Included in heartbeat searches |
| **warm** | 0.4 - 0.7 | Included in normal searches |
| **cold** | 0.1 - 0.4 | Only in deep searches |
| **archive** | 0.0 - 0.1 | Candidates for creative recall |

### Tiered Search

Different search depths retrieve different tiers:

- **heartbeat** — core + active (fast, low-cost)
- **normal** — core + active + warm (default)
- **deep** — all tiers (thorough)
- **creative** — random sampling from cold/archive (serendipity)

### Health Scoring

Vault health is scored on a 100-point scale:

```
health = 100 - orphan_penalty - broken_penalty - density_penalty - desc_penalty
```

- **orphan_penalty** — files with no incoming or outgoing links
- **broken_penalty** — wiki-links pointing to non-existent files
- **density_penalty** — low average link count per file
- **desc_penalty** — files missing retrieval filter descriptions in frontmatter

The vault-health skill auto-generates MOCs, repairs broken links, and suggests connections for orphans.
